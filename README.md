# This program prints a text based menu in the console for the user to interact with. All user information(favorite stocks/username) is saved in the storage.json file. A user can search stocks and save/add stocks to their profile.
 
# WARNING: For the stocks program to work you need an api key from tiingo. The cred file contains my personal key. IF you would like to use this program you will need to get a key from tiingo, create a module named cred and write your key in the program, like this: key = "7777777777". Then you can import it to this module.
